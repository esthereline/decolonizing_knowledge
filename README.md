Local and indigenous knowledge system has characteristics which are "knowledge-practice-belief" complex and are critical in the management and conservation of biodiversity of ideas in the indigenous lands.
Local and indigenous communities have strategized cultural practices which are embedded in religious and cultural institutions and values which form a system of knowledge.
Gathering and producing knowledge has been organized in such a way that it follows a specific hierarchy.
The hierarchy in gathering and producing knowledge depicts a conventional concept of knowledge transformations.
The hierarchy is very important because it enables artists and scholars to collect, present and produce knowledge to be consumed by different people in society (Koskinen, 2013).
The hierarchical gathering and production of knowledge are important because it ensures transmission of knowledge that is relevant to different individuals.
It also ensures the artists and scholars focus on a specific issue impacting a society.

According to the Western hierarchical system, data is raw information that is conceived of symbols and signs representing signals or stimuli.
The second hierarchy is converting raw data into information (Machlup, 2000).
Information may still consist of symbols and signs which are subjective meaning they can be utilized in a specific context.
The final hierarchy is processing of information to produce knowledge.
The knowledge contained mixed experience, contextual information, values and expert sights which provide an important environmental framework for understanding a particular situation.
Relationships in the information production are then revealed and an analysis is undertaken consequently over a time period.

Ubuntu traditional system of knowledge manages cultural knowledge to ensure effective expression of compassion, reciprocity, humanity and that which mutually benefits all the people in the society.
According to the Ubuntu traditional method of gathering and producing knowledge, it is universal and communal and each has unlimited access to it.
The community is indebted to distribute knowledge evenly across different classes in the society.
Contrary to the common hierarchical knowledge which promotes egoistic attributes, Ubuntu indigenous knowledge system embraces humility and selflessness in knowledge sharing.
Therefore, the Ubuntu system of knowledge produces knowledge here to act as contextual information, values, experience, and rules that bind a social setting.
The Ubuntu traditional knowledge has been kept in a way that allows information about the Ubuntu cultural setting.

The aspect of hospitality on decolonizing knowledge is depicted well in the Ubuntu system.
From the western point of view, knowledge is reserved for the few attached with ego.
In the Ubuntu system it embraces an aspect of community accessing the knowledge and the production is done systematically in the community.
Decolonizing knowledge expands the scope of access and authorship is not restricted to a few.
The system encourages open source approach of knowledge distribution (Machlup, 2000).
It is driven by the fact that all humanity is equal and no one should be denied access to valuable knowledge on the basis of affordability.
The hospitality of knowledge decolonization positively influences community interaction and appreciation of arts in relation in the knowledge aspect.
Through systems of knowledge, people show their honest, kindness and welcome people from different cultures.
Knowledge creates a smooth relationship between people from different backgrounds and thus they will interact in a peaceful manner.
