Local and indigenous knowledge system has characteristics which are "knowledge-practice-belief" complex and are critical in the management and conservation of biodiversity of ideas in the indigenous lands.
Local and indigenous communities have strategized cultural practices which are embedded in religious and cultural institutions and values which form a system of knowledge.
Gathering and producing knowledge has been organized in such a way that it follows a specific hierarchy.
The hierarchy in gathering and producing knowledge depicts a conventional concept of knowledge transformations.
The hierarchy is very important because it enables artists and scholars to collect, present and produce knowledge to be consumed by different people in society (Koskinen, 2013).
The hierarchical gathering and production of knowledge are important because it ensures transmission of knowledge that is relevant to different individuals.
It also ensures the artists and scholars focus on a specific issue impacting a society.

Ubuntu traditional system of knowledge manages cultural knowledge to ensure effective expression of compassion, reciprocity, humanity and that which mutually benefits all the people in the society.
According to the Ubuntu traditional method of gathering and producing knowledge, it is important to follow a particular hierarchical knowledge to maintain communities with justice and communalities.
The Ubuntu traditional system of knowledge follows a hierarchical way of gathering and producing knowledge in which the first step is to collect data.
Accordingly, data is raw information that is conceived of symbols and signs representing signals or stimuli.
Raw data cannot be produced until they are processed.
The second hierarchy is converting raw data into information.
Information is contained as descriptions and is known to be useful.
It is known that data is inferred to become information.
Information is structured or structured and organized data which has been converted to become relevant in a particular situation (Machlup, 2000).
Information may still consist of symbols and signs which are subjective meaning they can be utilized in a specific context.
The final hierarchy in the Ubuntu traditional system of knowledge is the processing of information to produce knowledge.
The knowledge contained mixed experience, contextual information, values and expert sights which provide an important environmental framework for understanding a particular situation.
Relationships in the information production are then revealed and an analysis is undertaken to find an answer relating to Who, When, What and Where questions.
Since the data might be broad converting them to information is paramount to make it specific and applicable to the relevant situation answering the questions stated.

The final and most important hierarchy is converting information to produce knowledge.
Accordingly, knowledge refers to a synthesis of different sources of information over a specific period.
The organization and processing of information result in knowledge that offers an understanding, accumulated knowledge, and experience.
Therefore, the Ubuntu system of knowledge produces knowledge here to act as contextual information, values, experience, and rules that bind a social setting.
The Ubuntu traditional knowledge has been kept in a way that allows tourists obtained information about the Ubuntu cultural setting.

Decolonizing knowledge/research is a way to undermine hierarchy.
And Ubuntu is thereby a way to cope with the other within the knowledge production itself, to open up the 'authorship' in a way and to create a dynamic knowledge system.
Wherein the ego isn't the main thing.
In relations to hospitality, Ubuntu system of knowledge offers an opportunity to the reader to see and obtain knowledge in the same way as the host and the guest.
The guest and the host will be in the position to critical internalize knowledge in a similar way.
However, that is what the hospitality means of course as it is open towards the “other.” The hospital requires that knowledge be gathered and produced in such a way that it is open to “other” and Ubuntu knowledge system does allow open access to the knowledge to others.
Through systems of knowledge, people show their honest, kindness and welcome people from different cultures.
Knowledge creates a smooth relationship between people from different backgrounds and thus they will interact in a peaceful manner (Machlup, 2000).
